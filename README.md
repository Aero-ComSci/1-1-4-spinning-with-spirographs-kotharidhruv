# 1.1.4 Spirographs

*Complete the following.*

1. Compare and contrast zero-iteration conditions and infinite loops.
2. A link to your code where you solve the following problem. Take the screen size of 800px. Create code or algorithm that always places the object(s), up to 5, in the center an equal distance from one another and from the edges of the screen.
3. Concentric Squares -- Add a screenshot of your result and the code to create it on your repo.
Objective: Write a Python program using the turtle module to draw a pattern of concentric squares. The pattern should be created using nested loops.

Instructions:

Setup the Turtle Environment:
Import the turtle module.
Create a turtle object.
Set the turtle speed to the fastest setting.
Draw Concentric Squares:
Use a nested loop to draw multiple squares.
The outer loop should control the number of squares.
The inner loop should draw each square.
Each square should be slightly larger than the previous one.
Customize the Pattern:
Use different colors for each square.
Ensure the squares are centered on the screen.
Example Output:

The turtle should draw a series of squares, each one larger than the last, creating a pattern of concentric squares.

Hints:

Use the penup() and pendown() methods to move the turtle without drawing.
Use the color() method to change the turtleâ€™s color.
Use the forward() and right() methods to draw the sides of the squares.


4. Complete the steps 17, 18 and 19 from [mypltw use clever to sign on](https://pltw.read.inkling.com/a/b/5310c007377c46e28d745961310f0c2e/p/728c751a6c4145bea0ea83c5058fb9f9#44b0003a2ee14fcc9865e7bb5faec747)
5. Answer to step 21
6. Insert a screenshot or picture of the algorith you used for your tokenizer on the previous activity.
7. Give an example of an undecidable problem, attach code.

## Zero Iteration and Infinite Loops
### Zero Iteration Loops
Zero iteration loops are loops that are never iterated over; hence the name 'Zero Iteration'

For example,
```python
name = "Dhruv"

while name=="Mr. Baez":
   print("Hi, Mr. Baez")
```
In the code above, the name has been set to "Dhruv". The while loop is set to be iterated over when the name is "Mr. Baez". Since the ```while name=="Mr. Baez``` statement returns false, the while loop is never going to be iterated over.

### Infinite Loops
Infinite Loops are loops that get iterated over infinitely many times, until the program is manually terminated.

For example,
```python
name = "Mr. Baez"

while name=="Mr. Baez":
   print("Hi, Mr. Baez")
```
In the code above, the name has been set to "Mr. Baez". As said before, the while loops is set to iterate when the name is "Mr. Baez". Since the while statement is returning ```True```, the statement in the while loop is being executed. Since we are not changing the value of ```name```, the print statement is being executed infinitely many times. That is why this type of loop is called the infinite loop.

## Screen Size Problem
[Link to solution to the problem](https://github.com/Aero-ComSci/1-1-4-spinning-with-spirographs-kotharidhruv/blob/e31ff41addaa5857ae774943b40f421d007f70e5/screensize.py)

## Concentric Squares
Result:
![concentric square result](https://github.com/Aero-ComSci/1-1-4-spinning-with-spirographs-kotharidhruv/blob/3c9ad8d4210827ba74426f68dd40507d8758fba5/concentric_squares_img.png "Concentric squares")

The Code:
```python
import turtle as trtl
import random

painter = trtl.Turtle()

painter.speed(100)

rainbow_colors = [ #AI Generated. Prompt: Generate a python list of 10 colors in the rainbow
    "Red",
    "Orange",
    "Yellow",
    "Green",
    "Blue",
]

position = painter.pos()

for i in reversed(range(20)):
    size = (i+1)*20
    painter.penup()
    painter.goto(position[0]-size/2,position[1]+size/2)
    painter.begin_fill()
    painter.pendown()
    painter.fillcolor(random.choice(rainbow_colors))
    for g in range(4):
        painter.forward(size)
        painter.right(90)
    painter.end_fill()

trtl.done()
```
## Step 21
The algorithm shown represents  the program where we draw five circles and are trying to avoid the zero iteration loop.

## Algorithm Used in the last Project
```python
flowerType = None
flowerNum = None

flowers = {
    ("daisy","daisies"):[15,"white","yellow"],
    ("sunflower","sunflowers"):[34,"yellow","#5C4033"],
    ("tulip","tulips"):[3,"#f49a5f","#f49a5f"],
    ("lily","lilies"):[3,"#ee82ee","#ee82ee"]
}

while flowerType is None or flowerNum is None:
    userInp = turtle.textinput("Flower Drawing", "Please enter the type of flower you want and the number of flowers: ")
    words = userInp.split()
    for word in words:
        for key in flowers.keys():
            if word.lower() in key:
                flowerType = key
        if word.isdigit():
            flowerNum = int(word)
        elif word.lower()=='a':
            flowerNum = 1

    if flowerType is None and flowerNum is None:
        messagebox.showinfo("Error", "Please enter a valid flower type and number of flowers.")
    elif flowerType is not None and flowerNum is None:
        messagebox.showinfo("Missing Number of Flowers", "Please enter the number of flowers.")
    elif flowerType is None and flowerNum is not None:
        messagebox.showinfo("Missing Flower Type", "Please enter a valid type of flower.")
```

## Undecidable Problem
### Code
```python
while True:
    pass

print("done")
```

### Explanation
In this code, the while loop keeps on running until something breaks the loop since we're saying ```while True```. When we write ```break```, there is no True or False statement being passed, making the loop undecidable. Since there is nothing being passed to escape the loop, the print statement will never be executed.
